Purpose
-------

This repo contains the Docker files used to compile containers
for running TXPipe, both at NERSC and elsewhere.

You don't need to run anything from this repo yourself - Joe does
that for you and pushes things to docker hub NERSC.


Using this image
----------------

See the TXPipe documentation for usage info.
